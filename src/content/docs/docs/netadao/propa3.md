Status: Executed September 2023

## Summary

This proposal asks stakers ratify the Neta DAO Constitution, available [here](https://bafkreie5hf5ixomxs2llg3dbg5j4he7wwgcintzzjqy5hojf7al7jc4nmq.ipfs.nftstorage.link/) as a PDF. This significantly completes the future work outlined in Proposal 2, with the remaining steps identified below.

This Constitution provides internal structure to the DAO and rules for its operations, as an addendum to the 'meatspace'-facing LLC Charter. Its major feature is the federation of subDAOs governed by a Congress comprised of members from both the subDAOs and the DAO. This federated structure is tasked with performing the operations of the DAO, with limits and public oversight on all positions.

To be abundantly clear, the text of this proposal is not the Constitution itself, which is available [here](https://bafkreie5hf5ixomxs2llg3dbg5j4he7wwgcintzzjqy5hojf7al7jc4nmq.ipfs.nftstorage.link/).

## Next Steps

If ratified, this document will be added in due course to the [netadao.zone](netadao.zone) website, minted as an NFT to the treasuries of the DAO and its subsidiaries, and included in the DAO's Terms and Conditions.

It will be followed by one or more more proposals including:

* a suite of subDAO Operating Policies that will initialize the DAO's operations, and
* any custom contract work to implement these new structures and DAO/subDAO relationships.

## Voting and Ratification

By voting YES, you ratify and become a signatory to this Constitution.

By voting NO, you indicate that this Constitution is deficient in some significant way. (Please note that the Constitution includes rules for its own amendment (Article 10, Section 4), so any errors that don't substantially affect the Constitution's meaning can be addressed by that process at any time.)

By voting ABSTAIN, you contribute to quorum without signing.

This Constitution will only be considered ratified by meeting quorum with an approval rate above 80%. If ratified, those members who voted No or Abstain will be considered bound by the Constitution.

Thank you for your time, consideration, and dedication to Neta DAO.
